* operationally
  * deploy 'quick fix' to prod (security, env specific artifact, etc)
    * bug affecting customers, easily fixed can be tested in other envs later
  * 'temporarily' stop deploys to an env
    * soak time/longer testing
    * freeze for demo
  * reproduce prod in other env
    * will the deploy system also handle data migrations, will they be 'part of the deploy', or 'another step'?
  * RCA/audit ability to find out what was running where, historically
